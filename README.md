## About me

#### My name is Sandra but I prefer to be called San or Paola which is my second name, I feel is easier and faster to say. I'm 18 years old and I come from Cali known as the branch of heaven in Colombia and in the world, but please don't ask me if I know how to dance salsa.

#### To get started, I'm a friendly person even though I don't seem like it because I'm a little shy and nervous when it comes to talking.

####  Continuing, one of my big hobbies is dancing (not salsa), I started about 7 years ago dancing Kpop but over time I expanded to dance more genres, I even use to have my dance cover group in Colombia where I loved participating in events.

#### Also, I love trying new food since I consider that all kinds of food have their special touch, always when I have free time and money, I really enjoy going out with my friends to eat in different places.

#### Additionally, other hobbies I have is read books online, watch TikTok SO MUCH that I even had to put a time limit on my phone, play online games, especially horror ones, and listen to music (pop, phonk, R&B, reggaeton, classic) it depends on the mood.

#### Lastly, I love animals, but my parents never let me have a pet, now that I live with my uncles here in Canada they have a kitten called Gaty, she is very cute and good company even though she has already destroyed some of my clothes and beauty blenders

### Why IDP3?

#### I selected this program in Fanshawe because I enjoy drawing and design that's why I want to explore my creativity and come up with new and innovative ideas, knowing different ways how to get inspiration, also I am totally new to the coding topic for which I have a lot of interest in learning and know how to handle it in the better way.
